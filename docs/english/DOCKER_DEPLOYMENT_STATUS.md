## Production Readiness Checklist
- ‚úÖ Containerized deployment
- ‚úÖ Database persistence
- ‚úÖ Health checks configured
- ‚úÖ Sample data loaded
- ‚úÖ Service networking configured
- ‚ö†Ô∏è SSL/HTTPS configuration needed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Environment-specific passwords needed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Backup strategy implementation needed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Monitoring and logging setup needed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Load balancing configuration needed (for production scale)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Containers not starting**: Check Docker daemon is running
2. **Database connection errors**: Verify postgres container is healthy
3. **Port conflicts**: Ensure ports 3000 and 5432 are available
4. **Permission errors**: Check file permissions for volume mounts

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check container health
docker inspect eaut_postgres | grep Health
docker inspect eaut_assessment | grep Health

# View detailed logs
docker logs eaut_postgres --tail 50
docker logs eaut_assessment --tail 50

# Test database connection
docker exec eaut_postgres pg_isready -U postgres

# Test application endpoints
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

## üéâ Deployment Successfully Completed!

The EAUT Assessment Platform is now fully operational in a containerized environment. All services are healthy, the database is populated with sample data, and the application is ready for use.

**Next steps for production deployment:**
1. Configure SSL certificates
2. Set up environment-specific configurations
3. Implement backup strategies
4. Set up monitoring and alerting
5. Configure load balancing (if needed)
