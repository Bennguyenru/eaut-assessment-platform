# GitHub Pages Setup Guide üìÑ

## Quick Fix for "There isn't a GitHub Pages site here" Error

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings

1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/Bennguyenru/eaut-assessment-platform
2. **Click on "Settings"** tab (top right of repository page)
3. **Scroll down to "Pages"** in the left sidebar
4. **Under "Source"**, select:
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main**
   - Folder: **/ (root)**
5. **Click "Save"**

### Step 2: Wait for Deployment (1-2 minutes)

GitHub will automatically deploy your site. You'll see:
- A green checkmark ‚úÖ when deployment is successful
- Your site URL: `https://bennguyenru.github.io/eaut-assessment-platform/`

### Step 3: Verify Your Site

After 1-2 minutes, visit: **https://bennguyenru.github.io/eaut-assessment-platform/**

You should see your EAUT Assessment Platform demo site!

## Troubleshooting

### If the site doesn't load:
1. Check the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. Look for the "pages build and deployment" workflow
3. Wait for it to complete (green checkmark)

### If you see a 404 error:
1. Make sure `index.html` is in the root directory ‚úÖ (it is!)
2. Check that the repository is public ‚úÖ (it is!)
3. Verify the GitHub Pages source is set to "main" branch

## Current Status ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ Repository created and public
- ‚úÖ Code pushed to main branch  
- ‚úÖ `index.html` and `styles.css` in root directory
- ‚úÖ Deployment buttons updated with correct URLs
- ‚è≥ **NEXT**: Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings

## Updated Deployment Options

Your `index.html` now includes working deployment buttons for:

1. **GitHub Pages** - Static demo (current setup)
2. **Railway** - Full-stack deployment 
3. **Render** - Cloud platform deployment
4. **Vercel** - Frontend deployment
5. **Docker** - Container deployment
6. **VPS** - Self-hosted solution

## After GitHub Pages is Enabled

Once you complete Step 1 above, all deployment buttons will work correctly and users can:

- View the live demo on GitHub Pages
- Deploy to Railway/Render/Vercel with one click
- Follow Docker deployment instructions
- Access VPS deployment guide

Your EAUT Assessment Platform will be fully deployed and accessible! üöÄ
